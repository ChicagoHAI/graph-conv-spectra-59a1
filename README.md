## Overview
This research investigates the spectral characteristics of graph convolution operators when applied to automated theorem proving systems. We establish novel theoretical bounds on the expressiveness of these operators in capturing mathematical reasoning patterns and prove key properties about their behavior in infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. This work bridges a critical gap between deep learning architectures and formal mathematical reasoning systems.

## Key Findings

**Spectral Convergence Rate**
- Proved that graph convolution operators converge at rate O(n^(-3/2)) in the spectral domain for theorem-proving tasks, significantly faster than the previously known O(n^(-1)) bound.

**Representation Capacity**
- Established a tight upper bound of 2^k on the number of unique mathematical patterns that can be learned by k-layer graph convolution networks in theorem-proving contexts.

**Stability Properties**
- Demonstrated that our spectral operators maintain ε-stability (ε < 0.01) under perturbations up to 15% of input graph structure, enabling robust theorem proving.

## Methodology
Our approach combines techniques from spectral graph theory and functional analysis to analyze the behavior of graph convolution operators in infinite-dimensional spaces. We employ a novel proof strategy using operator-theoretic methods and construct explicit counterexamples to establish tightness of our bounds.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/user/spectral-graph-proving
cd spectral-graph-proving
make build-paper
python3 -m experiments.run_all
```

## Limitations

- Analysis limited to countable-dimensional Hilbert spaces
- Computational experiments restricted to graphs with < 10^6 nodes
- Theoretical bounds may not be tight for non-Euclidean geometries
- Current implementation requires O(n^2) memory for n-node graphs

## Future Work

- Extend analysis to uncountable-dimensional spaces
- Develop more efficient implementations using sparse matrix operations
- Investigate applications to automated conjecture generation
