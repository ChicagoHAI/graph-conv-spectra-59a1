# Literature Review

## Background

The intersection of artificial intelligence and mathematical discovery has emerged as a rich domain combining formal logic, neural architectures, and automated reasoning. Building on Testolin's 2023 work on arithmetic capabilities of neural networks and Pantsar's 2024 research on theorem proving, the field establishes frameworks for automated mathematical discovery through both supervised and unsupervised approaches. The fundamental theoretical foundation relies on representing mathematical structures as learnable computational graphs, where spectral decomposition methods (as explored in Mo et al. 2024) enable discovery of inherent patterns and relationships.

Mishra and Moulik's 2023 work on conjecture generation demonstrates how modern AI systems can identify patterns in mathematical data to formulate testable hypotheses. This builds on classical automated theory formation (Pease et al. 2013) but introduces neural architectures capable of operating on abstract mathematical objects. The approach combines symbolic reasoning with statistical learning, allowing for both rigorous proof verification and creative mathematical exploration. Recent work by Linka and Kuhl (2022) on constitutive neural networks provides a framework for discovering mathematical models that describe complex systems, suggesting new directions for automated mathematical research.
